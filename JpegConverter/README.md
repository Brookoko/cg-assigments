# JPG/JPEG converter module 
## Description

## References: 
### Specifications and documentation:
- CCIT recommendation T.81: Infromation technology - digital compression and coding of 
continuous-tone still images - requirements and guidelines: [Recommendation document link](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf)

## Capabilities: 
### What should be done:
* Non-interleaved data unit encoding order 
* Baseline sequential DCT-based coding

### Future investigation: 
- Quantized coefficients encoding procedures:
  - Spectral selection
  - Successive approximation

### What wouldn't be done in near future:
- Interleaved data unit encoding order
- Extended DCT-based decoding processes
- Lossless encoding/decoding processes
- Progressive DCT-based mode
- Hierarchical mode
- 12-bits sabples coding
